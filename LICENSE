                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.

  By contrast, the GNU GPL is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  This license, the GNU GPL, applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 or (at your option)
any later version.  The "Program" refers to any such program or work,
and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, "modify" means to copy
and change a work in a fashion requiring permission under copyright
law.)

  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
